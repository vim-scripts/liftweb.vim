A plugin for vim to ease navigation for projects that use the Lift Scala web
framework. Heavily inspired by the awesome that is Tim Pope's rails.vim (at
http://rails.vim.tpope.net/) .

Currently provides a few commands:

* :Lmodel, Lsnippet, Lactor, Lcomet -- all take a class name and take you to
  the appropriate associated file
* :Lview -- takes a class name and takes you to the appropriate view file
* :Lspec or :Ltest -- when called from a class (e.g., GroupSnip), takes you to
  the associated test file (GroupSnipTest)
* :Lclass -- the opposite of Lspec, takes you to the class for the current test
